# Changelog
All notable changes to this package will be documented in this file starting from version 5.21.0.unr.0.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.27.0.unr.0] - 2025-11-17
### Added
- Added a LargeTextChannel option to the ChannelId constructor. With this feature enabled, text channels can support up to 2000 users.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where DisplayNames were not being properly passed with channels and directed messages.

## [5.26.1.unr.0] - 2025-05-02
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where it would not be possible to join channels on Nintendo Switch™ when running in compatibility mode.

## [5.26.0.unr.0] - 2025-03-31
### Added
- Noise suppression: Now applied to capture audio by default.
- Vivox Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) and Automatic Gain Control (AGC) are now available on all platforms. AEC and AGC were previously unavailable on Nintendo Switch™, PlayStation®, Xbox, visionOS, and UWP platforms.
### Changed
- The licenses and third party notices have been updated.
- Vivox Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) and Automatic Gain Control (AGC) have had their underlying algorithms replaced.
    - AEC on mobile platforms no longer mutes the microphone signal when echo is detected. Instead, echo is removed and speech continues to transmit.
    - AGC is on by default. The new AGC increases microphone capture loudness on all platforms. Consider adjusting application volume presets if they were changed from the default volumes; perhaps going so far as to reset user volume settings entirely or to adjust them by some formula.
    - For platforms that already had AEC and AGC, the new implementation including the addition of Noise Suppression has:
        - The same or less CPU cost than the previous implementation when using the Release configuration.
        - A reduction in memory usage of about 11 MB while a voice session is active.
    - For platforms that are getting AEC and AGC for the first time:
        - CPU cost of the Vivox audio thread increases by about 44% when using the Release configuration.
        - An extra 6 MB of memory will be used while a voice session is active.
    - Vivox library sizes have increased for all platforms due to the change in audio processing implementations:
        - Release configuration libraries add between 53 KB and 8 MB more to an application than the previous Vivox release.
        - Debug configuration libraries can add upwards of 12 MB more to an application than the previous Vivox release.
- Network optimization: A new default voice codec bitrate was chosen to reduce packet loss and jitter. The new setting was found to be indistinguishable from the previous setting in structured listening tests.
- `iOS`:
    - The `ios_voice_processing_io_mode` value now defaults to 1 rather than 2, meaning that the VoiceProcessingIO (VPIO) unit will only be used when the speakerphone is used for render and capture. This change favors the use of the new AEC underlying algorithms rather than the use of the VPIO unit to avoid the decrease in quality for most audio device configurations that come from using the VPIO unit.
### Fixed
- Fixed a crash with iOS Shipping builds in Unreal 5.3+ caused when disconnecting from a channel.
- Fixed a crash caused by the LoginSession object being deleted while HandleEvent is running.
- Vivox log levels were off-by-one. There may be more Vivox log statements now if `VivoxConfig.SetLogLevel` was used for your application.

### Removed
- `iOS`:
    - Removed bitcode in the iOS libraries.
    - Removed support for ARMV7 architecture on iOS platforms.

## [5.25.4.unr.0] - 2024-12-18
### Changed
- The licenses and third party notices have been updated.
- `Xbox`:
    - Improved handling of hotswapping capture and render devices.
### Fixed
- A bug where trying to join multiple channels quickly would lead to an exception.
- `Xbox`:
    - Issues preventing Remote Control functioning with Vivox through Xbox Manager. See documentation for full details.
    - A bug where USB audio devices were not being detected when plugged in.

## [5.25.0.unr.0] - 2024-08-23
- `iOS`, `Android`: - Enabled Unreal Engine custom allocators for all Unreal versions except for UE4.26 and UE4.27 on mobile platforms. Mobile platforms with those versions of UE are still excluded to avoid a crash.

### Added
- `macOS`, `iOS`:
  - Added a copy step to iOS and macOS builds to copy the PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file to the Xcode project.
- Moderation Module:
  - Added a new Module allowing for user sanctions for behaviours, powered by the Unity Moderation Service, available on the Unity Dashboard
- Vivox Safe Voice Consent:
  - Added two new API end points to LoginSession (BeginSetSafeVoiceConsentStatus and BeginGetSafeVoiceConsentStatus), allowing for Consent to be given for Vivox Safe Voice recordings if the feature is turned on on the Unity Dashboard.

### Removed
- Removed ensure() statements which could trigger when calling IAudioDevices accessor methods in some cases.

### Fixed
- Fixed issue related to LoginState not returned to LoggedOut after a failed connector_create. Leads to InvalidState error on subsequent login
    retries.
- Fixed `Error LNK1104 : cannot open file 'SceSha1.lib'` which could occur when building non-PlayStation platforms in environments where PLATFORM_PS4 is defined.

## [5.23.1.unr.0] - 2024-04-18
### Added
- `macOS`, `iOS`, `visionOS`:
    - Added the new PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy file. It is required in your Xcode project when generating your application's privacy report before submitting it to the App Store. For more details, refer to this page of the Unity documentation: <https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/vivox-unity/manual/Unity/privacy/apple-privacy-manifest>

- `PlayStation`:
    - A deadlock that occurs when Automatic Connection Recovery is triggered.

### Known Issues
-   Vivox crashes with Live Code in Unreal 5.2.
-   Vivox Unreal Plugin might have symbol conflicts when used with other plugins.
- `Windows`:
    - Starting multiple clients rapidly may cause Windows 11 to lose its ability to resolve DNS.
- `Xbox`:
    - If the SDK is initialized before an Xbox user is logged in on the console, controller events do not come through.
    - Mismatch of GDK versions with the Vivox SDK version leads to voice chat issues.

- `Android`:
    - An issue where all positional audio for the right channel could not be heard when using speakerphone.
    - An issue where Bluetooth devices reporting as Bluetooth Low Energy devices would be ignored, using the speakerphone instead.

## [5.21.2.unr.0] - 2023-11-16
### Changed
- Hidden all symbols related to C++ STL which were conflicting with some third parties, such as AWS Cognito, to avoid any conflict with other third party libraries used by our customers.
- `Android`:
    - Upgraded NDK to R25B to be aligned with Unreal Engine 5 NDK version and with other third-party plug-ins that use NDK R25B (i.e. AWS Cognito)
    - Reduced the size of the Android libraries.
- `Switch`:
    - Improved thread memory management.

## [5.21.1.unr.0] - 2023-09-13

- `Android`:
    - Fixed Android Bluetooth permission issues.
    - Added the Android symbols in Android SDK package
- `iOS`:
    - Fixed a duplicate symbol Issue.

## [5.21.0.unr.0] - 2023-07-25
### Added
 -   Text Chat (Vivox) features include a new Adaptive Chat Filter that provides real-time filtering of unwanted words and phrases and the following features (now in beta). To get started, see the [Text Chat Guide](https://docs.vivox.com/v5/general/core/5_21_0/en-us/Default.htm#text-chat-guide/text-chat-guide-overview.htm), and contact Unity Support for feature enablement.
    -   **Anti-flooding** (beta) - Achieve a balanced and enjoyable chat environment by customizing message length and frequency, preventing users from sending excessively long or frequent messages.
    -   **Text evidence management** (beta) - Retrieve all versions of flagged messages through an easy-to-use Server-to-Server API that allows integration into your own moderation dashboard.
    -   **Large channel support** (beta) - Large channels allow up to 2000 users for vibrant world chats and massive multiplayer experiences.

### Changed
- `iOS`:
    - Bitcode has been removed from the iOS SDK because it has been deprecated by Apple. Users should now disable bitcode in Xcode build settings for new projects.
- `Xbox`:
    - Xbox GDK SDKs will only be distributed as DLLs from this version onwards. This will reduce the size of the library, transforming it into an import library with accompanying symbols PDB. These changes were to align with the Windows release. Users should continue to link with vivoxsdk.lib to automatically load the DLL.
