To get started, please see the Developer First Steps of the Unreal Documentation on the Vivox Developer Portal (https://docs.vivox.com/v5/general/unreal/5_25_0/en-us/Default.htm#Unreal/vivox-unreal-first-steps.htm).

New Vivox Projects should be created on the Unity Dashboard, and credentials can be found there once created (https://cloud.unity.com/).
